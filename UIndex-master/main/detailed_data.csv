Auburn,"Auburn, Alabama, has been ranked one of the best places to live, and life at Auburn University can be similarly enjoyable for students. Football is a particularly big attraction in the fall, as fans support the Auburn Tigers with the help of school mascot Aubie the Tiger. The Tiger sports teams compete in the NCAA Division I Southeastern Conference, and the influx of football fans makes Auburn the fifth-largest city in the state on game days. Pep rallies are held in the downtown Toomer's Corner, and the area is covered in toilet paper by fans after every big victory. There are more than 500 student organizations on campus, and about 6,000 students are involved in the school's Greek system. Auburn freshmen ease into the college transition through Camp War Eagle, a two-day, overnight summer orientation program. Transition help continues on Hey Day, an annual effort to get students to wear name tags and say hello to one another. Freshmen do not have to live on campus; in fact, a dorm room isn't even guaranteed. Because of space restraints, first-year students are awarded on-campus living assignments on a first-come, first-served basis.As a land, sea and space grant institution, Auburn University receives federal funding for research projects that benefit the larger community. The school has an Urban Studio, where students can participate in community projects, and a Rural Studio, aimed at finding housing solutions for residents of West Alabama.

Oxford,"Miami University students make up three-fourths of the population of the approximately 7-square-mile town of Oxford, Ohio. Freshmen must live on campus, which is also home to more than 400 student organizations. The Greek system constitutes a large part of campus life, with about a third of the student body involved in nearly 50 fraternities and sororities. In fact, the school often gets the moniker ?é?Mother of Fraternities?é?because the Beta Theta Pi, Phi Delta Theta, Phi Kappa Tau and Sigma Chi organizations were founded at Miami University. The school is also known as ""Cradle of Coaches"" for the number of professional and collegiate coaches who once competed for Miami. The RedHawks, who compete in the Division I Mid-American Conference, were known as the Redskins until 1997. The name was changed after years of controversy and a request from the Miami Indian Tribe. (The tribe is the namesake of the university.) To help ease the transition into freshman year, older students often create a guide to life at Miami University, called the ""M Book."" Student couples who marry are known as ""Miami Mergers"" and are reminded of their alma mater each Valentine's Day, when the admissions office sends cards to congratulate former students on finding love at school.To travel around campus and Oxford, students can use the Butler County Regional Transit Authority buses, free with student ID, and the door-to-door SafeRide shuttle service after dark. Cincinnati and Dayton are 35 and 45 miles away, respectively. Notable alumni of Miami University include Paul Brown, Hall of Fame NFL coach; Richard Smucker, chief executive officer of The J.M.
